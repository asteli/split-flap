# split-flap
A mechanical split-flap display in the style of the Solari boards, designed to be modular, manufacturable, and low-cost.

The V2 is designed around a NEMA 17 motor, which paradoxically is much cheaper than the NEMA 08. Likely because it enjoys wide use in 3D printers and the like. They cost something like 5-8 USD wholesale. A friend happens to have a few hundred sitting around from an old project, which makes the choice even harder to resist.

The V2 also features a much larger character size (usable character area is roughly 60mm x 60mm -- old flaps were ~35mm wide), and is designed to be DIN rail mountable and powered/controlled via a common rail and bus for simplicity and reliability. The part count has come down significantly -- I've removed the (2) external bearings, as the NEMA 17 motor is large enough that I can trust its bearings to cope with the modest lateral loads involved.

When you are planning on building even 20 of something, every last part counts against you.
 
Update (September 16):
The CAD for the V2 split flap display is just about ready for a prototype build.
